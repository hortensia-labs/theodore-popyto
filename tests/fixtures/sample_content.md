# Sample Content for Testing

## Introduction

This document contains various APA citation formats for testing purposes.

## Standard Citations

Research shows that climate change impacts are accelerating (Smith, 2023). According to Johnson and Williams (2022), the effects are particularly pronounced in coastal regions. Multiple studies have confirmed these findings (Brown et al., 2021; Davis, 2020; Miller & Thompson, 2023).

## Narrative Citations

Smith (2023) argues that immediate action is required. Similarly, Johnson and Williams (2022) found significant correlations between temperature rise and sea level changes. Brown et al. (2021) conducted a comprehensive meta-analysis of 150 studies.

## Citations with Page Numbers

Direct quotes require page numbers: "The evidence is overwhelming" (Smith, 2023, p. 45). Longer quotes also need proper attribution: "Climate change represents one of the most significant challenges facing humanity in the 21st century" (Johnson & Williams, 2022, pp. 123-124).

## Complex Citations

### Multiple Works Same Author

Research by García spans several years (García, 2020, 2021, 2023). The author's work on renewable energy (García, 2020a, 2020b) provides comprehensive coverage.

### Secondary Sources

Early research suggested different outcomes (Thompson, 1995, as cited in Smith, 2023). This has been disputed by recent findings (Williams, 2000, citado en García, 2021).

### Personal Communications

The project director confirmed these findings (J. Smith, personal communication, January 15, 2023). Similar observations were made during field work (M. Johnson, comunicación personal, 3 de marzo, 2023).

## Special Cases

### Organizational Authors

Guidelines from major organizations support this approach (World Health Organization [WHO], 2023). The WHO (2023) recommends immediate implementation. Other organizations concur (United Nations, 2022; UNESCO, 2021).

### Legal Citations

This is supported by federal legislation (Clean Air Act, 1970). Article 15 of the Constitution provides the framework. Recent amendments (Law 123/2022) have strengthened these provisions.

## Format Violations for Testing

### Missing Punctuation

These citations have issues (Smith 2023) and need correction. The author Miller et al (2022) forgot the period. Wrong ampersand usage (Jones and Smith, 2021) in parenthetical.

### Invalid Year Formats

Some citations have problems (Johnson, 20023) with extra digits. Others are missing years (Williams, ). In press citations need special handling (Thompson, in press).

### Missing Bibliography Entries

These authors don't exist in the bibliography (Phantom, 2023). Neither does this one (Ghost & Specter, 2022). Multiple missing entries appear here (Nonexistent et al., 2021).

## Edge Cases

### Et Al. Variations

The study by Anderson et. al. (2023) has incorrect punctuation. Compare with proper format from Peterson et al. (2022).

### Mixed Languages

Investigaciones recientes (Rodríguez y López, 2023) muestran resultados similares. As noted by Müller and Schmidt (2022), European perspectives differ.

### URLs and DOIs

Online sources are increasingly common (Digital Library Association, 2023). Some entries include DOIs directly in text (Smith, 2023, doi:10.1234/example).
