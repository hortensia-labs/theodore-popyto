Introduction by Ilya Shabanov
All right. So, welcome to my presentation on step-by-step AI driven lit reviews with sci-pace. Uh, I already
did some introduction but I have the slide. So, um, the only thing that I would add is that I am let's say
representing or like I founded the effortlessacademic.com which is a platform that has been around since 2022
and we focus on teaching academics basically how to use different AI note
takingaking lit review tools. Um and I had so far over 15 webinars. So every
other month or so I do a webinar or a course. And uh yeah my biggest philosophy is that you have to learn to
use the tools well before you have many of them. So don't feel you know don't run to the next shiny thing. Just stick
to one thing. It's usually will be uh the best choice you can make. And what
we are going to focus on today is bas basically the review process from
framing a research question using scissace topics. So this might be relevant for you know the less senior
you are because as a faculty person you already have a very clear idea of topics
and so on but sometimes you might want to uh kind of pivot into a slightly different direction. Let's say you're an
ecologist and now you want to do some computational ecology because that becomes really essential. So that is
something where you would find these topics useful. Then we're going to dive into how to actually you know break
these down uh using deep review and uh we're going to organize all these
 Why Start with Topics, Not Papers
insights and then in a notebook and basically create step by step a document that will guide us through the whole
thing. And for me it's important that we kind of dive first and build this vast
understanding or like a broad understanding of things before we actually go into the papers. And whenever I talk to people that's what
they find the most uh difficult thing is not to get overwhelmed because it's very easy to just go online search for uh
your topic and then just start saving these papers without end that's very very easy but then you end up with a 100
papers with no way of saying like what is important what is not important so my philosophy is like be really really
frugal like collect these papers really carefully and AI can help you skim through these papers and understand
basically what is relevant and what isn't. Uh, a really cool feature in SciPace is that you can scan papers in
bulk. That is very very useful towards the end of your um, literature review
when you kind of, you know, you get the broad concepts, you know, the big papers that everybody knows, you understand it, but now it goes into the nitty-gritty,
you know, where there's like a hundred different papers that all published basically the same thing in a slightly different angle. Like how do you get um
to this really to the nectar of all these papers? And that's what the bulk scanning is for. And then there's a
short uh outline on ethical uh and limitations considerations of AI which I
think is also important to acknowledge because um especially when you're new to
AI you might think oh I type something in it sounds human so it is kind of human but you're assuming the wrong
things. Something that talks like a human is far from being a human and it will make completely childish mistake
but be very very good at something that you couldn't even imagine it could be good at. So it's a different type of
intelligence and that's what we want to understand. So let's get started with
the first thing which will be um the topics and I mentioned already that what
we want is you want to start very broadly. So keep all of that in mind when we're going to go through the live
demo. We're going to focus on keywords not papers at the beginning because first now here is an example. We want to
see what are the effects of climate change and for example forests die off um tree mortality increases which is the
same but kind of from a different angle because forest is more than just trees. There are also bushes and ferns and so
on. Um there is increased drought. So there are different subtopics inside of
your review. That's what we're going to have without even thinking about papers. So we want to build a feeling for the
field and understand the clusters and the topics that are important and these
clusters or even you know sets of clusters they later become a paragraph
in your literature review. So let's get started on that. I'll just start with Arc here and uh let's close all the
other ones. Uh for those not familiar so Arc is just a browser. It's uh like a
Chrome browser. Um don't use it anymore. has been discontinued. So, but I'm going to start here on Cyspace and I'm just
going to close it. So, this is basically where you would start if you come on the website and here on the left side there
is the idea of finding um topics, right? So, let's go to find topics and we're
 Live Demo: Finding Topics with SciSpace
going to search for plant change effects on
forests. So, let's see what this will bring us. So, there are two different
settings, standard and high quality. So, I'm right now I'll be using high quality. In my experience, the
difference for that particular feature is not that great. So, you get more or less the same topics, but you kind of
get a few more topics if you're using high quality versus if you're using um standard
quality. So, um yeah. So, even if you're using the free version, standard will do
good. So, what we have now is first of all at the top we have the answer that
comes from five topics. So these answers are completely um AI generated. Yeah.
What do we have to keep in mind with AI? It is never 100% complete. Yeah. So
don't expect that what is here is everything there is to know. It is in
99% of the cases factually completely correct. But it is um I would say maybe
like in 80% or let's say in 20% of the cases there's something missing. So
there's a big chance that this is not kind of the whole um the whole pie. This is a part of the pie and you will have
to go through that process multiple times. So um this will basically tell
you an answer and this will bring you to the single that exist. So what I always
focus on is these um single topics because that's what we're here for. we are about to build like a broad
understanding of a topic and uh what we can do is we can use this save to
notebook button. So let's create a new notebook and I will call this notebook
uh our climate notebook and I'll put it here in in a
folder. So a notebook is essentially just um yeah it's just a piece of text.
Um yeah, so this is our climate change effects
on forests notebook. And what we can do is we can
save things to this notebook. And what you see is it just basically copied this
whole text to the notebook. And throughout the whole platform you will have that save to notebook thing which I
think is not always super super useful because it just basically copy and pastes what is there and whenever we
take notes the number one rule is is not to copy and paste because that doesn't
help you remember things. So let's say we are going to open this in full screen. So what I did here is I just
opened the notebook in a separate tab and arc allows me to put these tabs side
by side. That is a little bit better than this kind of pop out that um the UI in size offers because this will cannot
be closed right. So I can just kind of you know have that on the side here and
um yeah we're going to remove this entire text for now. Just
have to maybe make it a tiny bit smaller. Um, move the zoom window here out of the
way. All right. So, climate change effects on the forest. And what I'm do is I'm going to collect these topics and
um the first thing might be forest dieback then uh then you know
reduced forest cover. To make them a little bit bigger you can type in one,
two or three hashtags. So this makes it into like uh big or less big headers. So
I prefer uh three hashtags uh altered
composition of forests. So if you're not an ecologist, um bear with me. So these
are just different topics that happen inside the forest. And what I also like to do is because I'm just starting out
on these topics, I want to mark it as something that I haven't kind of looked deeper into it yet. And I really like to
use emojis for that. So on Mac OS, you would use um the combination control,
command, and space to bring that uh emoji thing. On Windows, it's something else, but don't don't ask me exactly
what it is, but it's also like it's a similar combination. And so what we want to do is we basically want to to go
through a few of these topics and just collect them for now because um there is no need in rushing also our literature
review. It's always good to um be thorough. Yeah. And um that notebook as
you might have just seen it allows sometimes you know it um it suggests these AI suggestion and says okay
climate change can lead to significant habitat changes. I would just press tab. Um, ideally it would accept it, but um I
don't know why it didn't do it yet. Uh, let's wait for it again. See if
 Creating a Research Notebook with AI
it suggested. Okay, accept suggestion and maybe turn it into a paragraph.
Um so yeah so Scypace will always try to help you kind of defining or writing
because it treats that notebook less as a notebook and more as a kind of draft
for writing which is fine but um yeah you know just keep that in mind that's why these things kind of pop up you can
also type in hashtag and then ask AI to write um for example define what is
habitat change and it will try to write it for
you uh and maybe uh in one sentence. Let's see if that looks
better. Okay, that looks good. So yeah, so now you know if you are if you're not familiar with things, you can basically
ask questions. So you don't need to go to chat GPT and kind of try to define those things. You can just do it all exactly in here. Um but we can also of
course once we have uh a list of these things because this will not be you know like four this should be you know 16 20
40 50 topics for a whole literature review. So this will really take time to build that um but you will soon notice
that there are kind of um different things or different clusters of topics
emerging. So for example, yeah, if we just look keep kind of looking through
it, uh we might find something like uh effect like impacts on biodiversity. So
yeah, how many species are in the forest that is impacted by the climate change
that affects forests and you know certain species will die and certain species will live and uh yeah and we can
say okay what are the impacts of biodiversity on forests with respect to
climate change and create a new uh topic search. So impacts of uh on
biodiversity impacts of climate change on biodiversity in
forests. So now we're kind of drilling deeper into our understanding. So first we had uh like a very narrow uh like a
very broad set of ideas. Now we can kind of take each of those things and expand
them into more topics, more sets.
So after we have done that then you know I would basically continue filling that climate notebook with uh ideas that uh
you know I find here. So here's for example you know species distribution shifts. So that is that is again a new
um topic. Yeah. So whenever you know the climate kind of
heats up then certain animals will migrate away other animals will migrate in. So this will kind of shift where the
distribution of this species is located and that's what is going to happen and it's indeed like a very very big
um thing in in ecology right now is to predict how things are going to shift.
So that would be very very important um and yeah scace is already suggesting
what it means. So yeah, so that's how I basically would start doing that. And
um what I would like to to kind of keep in mind is that each of those kind of
blocks yeah let's say impacts on biodiversity has this then it has like another bunch of things. So there
there's you know like one topic two topic three topic four and so on. So when you're later writing a paper, yeah,
so I can show you how that looks for me for example, I have uh like a question,
how does climate change affect forest worldwide? What is the problem? Yeah.
And so that that becomes a paragraph in my writing. But this question here that you see in my paper, my actual paper is
exactly kind of this question that I have here. Right? So all these four or five topics these are the topics that
you initially find in in this idea and then later you know we find all the papers and all the right citations to
actually add to the entire literature review process. So um yeah so that concludes
basically the topics then we can move on to the next part. Um yeah so actually
one one small if you want to know how I take notes because note takingaking is like a
really big skill and this this is beginning right so you could actually create a much more nuanced note-taking
strategy which will allow you to um yeah find things over time over you know five
years of your PhD you will build this note uh vault and that is something that
will be incredibly useful in the future. So go to effortlessacademic.com and leave your email and then you're part of
a free 8day digital note-taking course course you do it and the very basic
steps and it will really help you synthesize information completely transformed my career. So highly highly
recommend it to get started with uh obsidian note-taking. But okay, the next step is we want now to build a deeper
understanding with the searches that we have because before that we kind of only built this this broader understanding of
 Using Deep Review for Focused Exploration
topics but not really any papers not really anything else. So here we are aiming for a deep search and we are um
using the regular search for kind of more niche questions because the main difference for me between deep searches
and regular searches in sci-pace and also in other tools is just how much information they consider. So the more
niche a topic the less information is there to consider about it and kind of the less you need the deep search and the more you want to automate everything
the more you would want deep search to happen. and we're going to make topical notes on these different subjects. We're
gonna wait still with collecting papers and kind of first learn what are the
important topics here and I have picked the topic of drought. Uh let me just
copy and paste that question. Uh so we have one big thing
here that would be uh drought. Yeah. So drought affects uh
forests. Um yeah, so drought affects forest and we want to know how does
drought affect forest. So what we're going to do is we're going to go here to literature
review and I'm going to paste a question which is how has has drought increased
with climate change and how does this affect forest ecosystems? There are three buttons standard, high quality and
deep preview. So um let's go first with the preview
part uh or actually let's start with a just with a normal high quality search.
So this will just kind of look for papers and the way that works is that
each paper has you know contains a bunch of words. Yeah. And that question also contains a bunch of words. So what AI
does is it found a clever way of how to compare two texts whether they are similar. So if a question is similar to
a paper, you will get papers that are very very similar to that um like relevant to that query. And that's how
all of AI works is basically on this text similarity that has been just recently cracked how to build that.
Yeah. So what you get is you get an answer from 10 papers and you get you
know 10 out of 100 papers. That's what I mean. If we run the deep search then we
get 700 300 papers and so on. Uh so it's a lot more intricate but that already
can give us um a really really good uh kind of overview of what we should be
studying. So increased drought frequency and severity impacts on forest ecosystems biodiversity. So again this
is kind of the boring part but what I like to do is actually to do that by hand. Yeah. So I would say okay
frequency of droughts is increasing as just like one note that I
take on this and that's a topical note right that's the note is really related to the drought I don't really care about
papers right now none of that is relevant you know so I find this advice of like find all the papers that are
relevant is just wrong because it it it overwhelms you a lot and we we're going
to find enough papers um you know it's not the hardest thing to find papers All right. So, um yeah, you're going to
start collecting these things and add kind of additional questions also. For
example, um ecological transformation that might be something that we would
want to add as a new topic because that seems uh like a a relevant topic and um
I I don't know what it means, but I find kind of new keywords that I would want to add to my uh literature review. U but
here Yeah. So um so here maybe you know reduced vitality is something that I
would um add here
increased loss of leaves so and so on. So you get the idea. Basically, you know, like you get to to search and I'm
going to show you how deep preview makes it essentially uh easier because what deep preview is
going to do is is going to ask you follow-up questions like um are you interested in specific forest in
specific ecosystems? What geographical context? For example, I am right now in
um New Zealand and that's on the southern hemisphere. So southern hemisphere has quite different uh
forests from somewhere uh in Russia. Yeah. Uh and that is again very
different from more arid environments like um you know subsaharan Africa. So
all all these reactions will be different and that's really important to actually nail them down and as a beginner I might not even be aware that
this is a valid question. So um even just because there is this question you know I could ask uh I could add another
point that I want to review is um um does geographical
uh context matter for um climate change impact on forests? Yeah. So that is
something that you will definitely want to answer in your um literature review.
But I generated this again from just kind of looking at at the questions. So we can say for now uh we focus on
forests in New Zealand um and uh primarily are interested in I
don't know forest mortality or something like that. Yeah. So I just just give it an answer and it's going to go and it's
going to search for for many many papers and that can take you know quite a while uh until this deep search is completed
and that is because you will have multiple papers that are going to be analyzed and then the AI will basically
decide is that paper relevant not relevant then it will kind of take from these papers read whatever it can in
depth and kind of start creating an argument. So this is an iterative process that is very very similar to
what people would do when they were would do it um manually but now kind of AI does it
and of course the biggest problem is that AI is not really great at reasoning and it's not really great at saying like
what is super important and what is not important because importance for AI is often defined by frequency. So if
 Evaluating AI-Generated Results
something often comes up it must be important but it's not always the case right and so all these tools like
scissace that are building um tools for deep review they are challenged by
creating something that can actually discern what is important and what is not. Um so this leads me always to this
one problem like whatever AI gives you um it is usually not false but it might be incomplete and so that is your your
task as a diligent um user of AI to understand and uh put the trust where
it's due. Um yeah so the cool thing about deep preview is also um that you
can see um which papers are analyzed, how many and it kind of goes step by
step. That's really nice. So yeah, so what you get again is you get a really lengthy reply which is now much much
more nuanced than what you had before. So from that reply I could definitely generate another 10 15 topics. Yeah. And
like don't don't be alarmed like there will be a lot of topics at the end but that's the purpose of a good researcher review is to touch on each of these
topics and maybe you know it it will be half a sentence in your final review but it should be there to begin with. Um
yeah so that is uh basically yeah the the d preview part and what we'll see
here is at the bottom it will tell you it used 366 papers so that that's pretty
pretty good and what I also like to do is because that is drought relevant and
I would want to come back to that document is I just copy and paste that link
here and uh I just say okay well here my um deep search oops sorry let's put it
as a paragraph and then click that link button here and enter that URL so that
you know next time next time when I want want to um like work on that part I can
always just click that button and it will take me directly to this screen and I can kind of continue interacting here
and then at the end you know I will have many many deep searches linked here and this will become like my central
document that leads me into different parts and also if you know parts of this document become too big you can split
them often create like a different notebook for that. Uh but yes, so for example, you know, like again role of
vapor pressure deficit is something that we didn't do previously. So we can do uh we can add that to our uh yeah to our
collection here. Uh and again there is almost everywhere the possibility to add
things to your um notebook. So if I click that button um it will essentially
copy and paste this whole thing at the bottom here which is not always what you
would want. Um but it might be something that you know you want and you would start going through them one by one and
kind of eliminate things. Um but yeah I prefer to do it manually. Um but yeah that's all there's always this option to
do that. Um there's really good understanding you know the impact of uh geographical regions. So for example
here I could already start and say okay well these are the impacts maybe I'll put it even here this table instead of
drought but that's really interesting right so you see that this literature is
kind of slow coming along if you're really really lazy like things you can
do is you can just uh copy and paste this whole text here and you can just paste it here and you can select the
whole thing and say um to AI I shorten it into uh three
bullets and um yeah and so the result is yeah it's a much much shorter version of
that. Um yeah so if if you're really lazy and you really don't want to take
your own notes that's a valid possibility to kind of just copy and paste and use AI to shorten that if
you're you know generating it as a as something for to hand out to students for example. Yeah, you know all that
stuff already. You just kind of want it to be uh really quickly um digested. That would be an option. So yeah, so we
still have not really cared about papers so much. So we are still at the point of building a really a broad level
understanding and trust me like it's it will save you so much time to understand
 Collecting and Filtering Research Papers
at first like what are the different parts that are relevant without going
into papers. Yeah. So maybe you know you don't know what vapor pressure deficit is. So yeah, so you read up on this, you
understand that and now you know okay well this is a a concept that is very important when it comes to understanding
drought and forest and climate change and once you understand all that all these concepts you know on a very broad
level that's where it will be really easy to collect papers because now you can actually understand what is
important and what isn't. So you gained uh a possibility to filter through the
papers yourself as a beginner in that you don't know which of these papers is kind of better or worse. Like it's okay
like everything seems relevant. Yeah. And that's what people do. They just like click click click click click collect collect collect more and more
more but more is always worse in literature review. It's about like targeting the right papers and very
often you know you read like three four good papers you're done in your understanding. Yeah. The rest is just
reshuffleling of information. So be really really selective and protective of this you know urgency to collect
papers. Okay, let's move on to the step three out of four I think and that is
now to actually collect and read the papers. And uh I always tell people to
prioritize very recent citations from high impact journals. Why? because it
makes it very easy for you to um you know find new papers because usually
high impact journals will publish stuff that has been thoroughly researched.
There's in nature you know there's always 20 people uh 20 authors per paper. So um you know there's a lot of
work that went into it and you can use that work and you can look at the papers that these papers site and this is your
bibliography. You know this is where you find everything that's known on a topic. If that paper is in addition review
itself and it is very recent then chances are you know like this is really gold because that saves you a lot of
time because it has everything on one topic already there and you don't need to kind of ask AI every single question
because you know 20 authors publishing something in nature will always be better than AI but AI can help you find
these papers and kind of find the nuances um to these single questions but we'd always start you know somewhere in
between um yeah we will always double check citations that um AI gives us. So
for example here it says you know some proposition European forests have experienced severe droughts and gives us
like three papers. So 99.9% this will not be hallucinated or
this will not be wrong but it might not always be the right citation and one
example is preprints. So we can find a lot of preprints uh here that have not been published. So
if you have a pre-print that has not been peer-reviewed, that has not been published, there's something wrong with it. I never cite that. So we have to
really pay attention to what we are actually citing. Um yeah, so as I said,
few top-notch papers and use AI to fill the details and niches out later. So AI will be better the more kind of niche we
get in my opinion. Um yeah, and how do we do that? Well, for example, here we
start with a deep review on um the topic of the drought effects on forests and we
already have 366 papers. Yeah. And we want recent high impact uh papers. So in
order to find them, we can for example um filter by the last three years.
That's what I would usually do. And um yeah, just start kind of
looking through it. you will always get these um these hints here. Nature
reviews, earth and environment, visual education, nature communications, um annual review and so on. So these are
the the different journals. So, what I usually do is if you're completely new,
just go to a a web page like um let me just maybe close it and
um yeah, let's open it here on the side.
So, that is just a web page where I can say okay, what is this nature reviews uh
earth and environment and just kind of get an idea how impactful that is. So
that is for example an impact factor of 50 which is incredibly high while nature
communications yeah it sounds like oh it's also nature journal it is uh just
14 so there is a big difference between them and if I kind of go further down here and I find um I don't know let's
say science of the total environment that might be um that's
actually also a good journal but yeah so this this allows you to basically gauge
how impactful a journal is using this journal impact factor. And uh that is something you
only do, you know, in the beginning when you really have no clue. But you know, once you're in it, you know that visual
education, for example, is not a journal that publishes ecology. Like I've never heard about it. Like I've never find it.
So I will not consider that paper. I will not consider looking at it so closely as I would on one that is for
example in in nature communications. And so what you would do is um it's also
global field observations. So it gives you already an idea. Is it like a review or is it more like a collection of
observations, a meta review and so on. So what I do is I'll start bookmarking them and I'm going to add them to a
folder called drought so that you know slowly filtering through them like reading the
insights that scissace gives for me here and very very carefully selecting just a
bunch of papers. So I did that yesterday already. So some of them are already bookmarked as as drought papers and they
are usually you know these high high impact papers that we want. Um so once I've done that I can
also start and basically you know site things here. So for example, if I have
that paper here, small and slow drought tolerance of tropical tree species, um I
can say something like, you know, tropical tree species react stronger or
strongly to drought and I can uh you know put just usually the um the author
 Extracting Key Findings from PDFs with AI
uh G Mo 2022 uh just to have it, you know, to have an
idea. Okay, this is the paper. So, I think that's a temporal thing. So, there is a site button here, but um whenever I
search for uh the author, I will not find it. And I think that's that's
temporary bug that I also submitted to to the people. Um so, I just can't find
the paper. But technically, you know, Scypace will be able to add those citations so that you can just kind of
click on them and they will um they will be much more um easy to access because
they will actually be linked. Uh but yeah, let's let's go into this and uh
check out the paper
itself. Yeah. So there is no replacement for actually reading the paper. Yeah. So
I think a lot of the time people want to just go and say oh my god that is so
much to read but there's no replacement. Yes if you want to be a scientist you will have to read these papers. But AI
can help you after you have read these papers and you have an understanding um to basically really condense something
into like easier notes. So what I like to do is I like to ask um extract three
pieces of information that are unique findings of this study. So let's uh clear that chat and um that allows me
later when I have to write something to say hey um this is what has been found and this
here that here is the study that has found this and these are basically the things that I can write about that
study. Right? So of course it it presumes that I have already read and I kind of have a feeling that this is not
wrong. Yeah. So you have to kind of look skim at least through the things to understand that this is not wrong. But
then after you have done that uh you can again uh like save that to the notebook.
Yeah. And this this goes into our um notebook here at the bottom. And uh
yeah, we can maybe copy it to our drought
research thing and you know maybe we we want to shorten it maybe you know maybe only two of them were relevant but
that's basically how I would want it to be that I have
um some some sort of topic drought effects and I have some sort of
proposition drought tolerances P50 and TLP exhibit weak
phoggenetic signal. So whatever that means, it doesn't matter right now. But what is important is I have a sentence
that I could plug in into my literature review and I have a citation for that sentence and I am pretty confident that
this really matches what the study has actually found. So for that I always recommend you know double check what's
happening. You will get a feeling for what type of things AI can get wrong and what not. But 99% of the time like this
is actually pretty on point. Uh what you can do here though is you can say that
the response length you want it longer you want the tone kind of more simple academic or professional. So let's say
you know we want like kind of a longer more professional replies and just see what the same query query will generate
for us. Yeah. So compared to the previous
reply which is like four lines we get almost twice as long of a reply and uh
yeah this is maybe even you know better to understand. You can even click on these parts and it will show me inside
this PDF basically where is something happening. So I find that that very very
useful. I'm not a huge fan of um you know chatting with PDFs and just
generally asking things because scientific literature has already been set up that you know all the summaries
that you would need are there. If you want a summary of the paper uh um sorry
if you want the summary of the paper you can read the abstract. Yeah, in most cases the abstract will be better than
what would be generated by AI because it is written by humans that understand the
topic better than AI. If you want to see exactly what the study did, uh then go
to the last paragraph of the introduction, this here we paragraph usually that will tell you exactly what
the study did. If you want to see exactly like the summary of all the findings then you would usually go to
the first paragraph of the discussion section and it will summarize everything that they have found. If you want to see
the impact of the study then go to the last paragraph of the discussion section
something here broader implications. So these are the summaries that you would need. You could generate them with AI
but they are already there you know so you don't need to reinvent the wheel when it comes to like summarizing things. But what AI is really great for
is finding specific things on specific narrow niche topic. So for example, does
this study uh mention uh tropical rainforests
and their sensitivity to temperature or something like that. So yeah. Yeah.
Write something that's much more nuanced and long. And what it will do is it will basically act as a search function
inside the PDF and give me parts where it speaks or doesn't speak about it. Uh
and that makes it very very handy not so much for reading but for um double-checking like is this study
really helpful for a specific um purpose. So so let's go back. Yeah. And
that's that's what we get at the end. we would get, you know, 10, 20, 30 of these
little paragraphs and you will align them then later and combine them to get
something that looks more like this. So something that you can basically start publishing. Um so yeah, so that's that's
our idea. And what I like to do is like once I've analyzed everything and I have
created all of that then I will um gift that guy uh like a yellow
 Bulk Analyzing 20+ Papers for a Single Question
uh sorry a green emoji instead of the yellow emoji. Yeah. But you can have your own system so that you have
basically an overview uh which which things you still need to work on and which things you're already done
with. All right. So that was our collecting papers part.
And then there's one more thing that's kind of also more towards the end when you have too many papers already and you
know because every time you run these searches you will maybe only collect three or four papers but you know you
have uh a dozen or so of topics. So you will end up with like 50 60 papers but then again you know a good lit review
has round about 100 references and that's essentially what we end up with is to have a big big big collections of
references. Um, so finding the needle in the haststack. Yeah, bulk searches.
That's what sci-pace is really really good at is or you know AI also in general is to use it as a search. So I
just showed you how we can use that search to search one PDF. But what if we could take you know 100 PDFs and search
for that. That's what I uh call kind of bulk searching. And we're going to look at that. I'm going to go to my library.
That's where all my um folders are, all my notes, all my um PDFs and so on. And
I'm going to go and use that uh ELR4 collection that is from a webinar that
I've been giving just so that you know we don't have to collect. Maybe we can even close that guy here. Uh so it just
contains many many many papers. I'm going to delete that. And these papers
are on uh range shifts. So whenever temperature changes
uh trees will start migrating. Yeah. That means that you know something that
has been growing here now wants to grow over here because it's too hot for it to grow here and it wants to grow over
there. And you know invasive species also move around. So it's not only animals that move around but also trees.
And that's exactly what is um kind of the main subject of my research. And so after like collecting like in this case
it's only 24 papers I want to bulk search all of them and what I can do is
I can create a new column and let's call it range shifts and I'll give it an
instruction and the instruction is uh sorry I wanted to copy and
paste that from my other screen. Yes. Uh sorry. Yes. So
does this study support the statement tree range shifts are strongly
driven by temperature? So that is something I call a focal statement. Yeah. So I have a preposition that these
range shifts so these movement of the ranges of the trees are somehow influenced by rising climatic
temperatures. And uh it may or may not support that. It may or may not be true. Like in reality it's true for about half
the plants. the other half does not follow temperature. We don't really know 100% why. Um, but yeah, so the AI is
supposed to analyze whether or not this study that I have here on the left supports that preposition or not. And it
should reply with a yes, no, or partially. And again, I like to use emojis because that gives you a little
bit um, yeah, of an understanding like more visual person. So, let's create
that column. And what it's going to do is it's going to now read these papers one by one. And by the way um here I
have uploaded all the PDFs manually uh because I'm you know space might not
have access to the paper but your university does. So once you collect all these papers you can add them to size
and you can add the PDFs you can upload them and then you basically would have um yeah like a good collection where the
AI can operate on the entire uh collection not just on like single
pieces of it. So here is the result. So you can get okay no no no partially okay
interesting no no maybe there's like some study that supports it more uh rigorously because that is a proposition
that might not be um yeah like as I said it's not something that is actually true
but you know there is some some sort of interest dynamic here for example that paper written in 2023 does not support
it that paper written by the same author in 2020 partially supports that so that's something where I would say oh
wow that's that's actually interesting you know and then maybe you know there was some sort of development between
2020 and 2023 that led to rejecting that theory that rain shifts are driven by
temperature right so that allows me to find that needle in the haststack so I think for that question and this
collection there is no not a single paper where it will tell me yes but essentially like that's what we're
looking for we're looking for this green dot that would tell me yes that paper actually supports that or here in that
case I would read into the partially papers and like really focus on them because that allows me to create that
that focal question and analyze 24 papers in bulk basically running a
search against each of them. So that's I think is pretty cool. Uh for medicine you know if you were be doing medicine
you could say uh is this a double blind controlled study? Yeah like because
you're only interested in those. It's not suitable for systematic reviews but it's really really useful for just your
own review. Uh you could ask for example is that study done in animals in birds
in plants? Yeah that's something I as an ecologist very often ask because trees can change ranges but also animals and
also birds and also all all the other fish but what fish do usually does not correlate very well with what trees do.
Right? So that's um that's a little bit why it's it's important and we can add you know um a column um for example
study um uh sorry um who uh region and say uh what geographic
region is this study made? write one uh
word for location or an A if uh not
applicable. Yeah. So it's the same way I'm extracting like a very kind of niche
piece of information out of many studies at once. Yeah. And then I can go ahead and you know hopefully it will give me
some results soon. [Music] So, Eastern United States, that's
already pretty pretty clear for me that you know as an ecologist I would know that Eastern United States and like what
is the difference in forest to New Zealand and you know that could give me an understanding whether or not I should read that paper or not or if I should
site it in a specific context. All right. I don't know. I think it's um yeah being a bit slow but
okay you you get the idea. Yeah. So that is the systematic
review. The other point that you can also do is you can kind of select all these papers and you can chat with these
15 papers at once. So I call this the research oracle because it essentially if you have papers that are all on one
very niche topic, you can um you you you can ask the AI to extract everything you
know in that topic and answer any question that is known on that topic. For example, um drivers of range shifts
for trees is something I want to know. And it's going to analyze 15 files and
give me a summary basically. Um no relevant context. Sorry, I think I
have to restart that.
[Music] Um yeah, so there's some some sort of
 Chatting with Multiple PDFs (Research Oracle)
little hiccup. Yeah. And then there there you go. You know, you get kind of ideas. So that condenses information
into like a short paragraph from many papers at once and that extracts this needle in the haste. So there's two ways
of basically bulk analyzing papers for your uh literature review which I find
both extremely valuable. Um and then of course again you go ahead
and you go back to your um to the notebook that we have created. So this
was our climate notebook here and you can continue adding to it as you go and
as you search and create this kind of massive document. Um you don't have to do it here in SciPace if you don't want
to. You know you can do it even on a pen and paper if you're more of a you know haptic person. Uh but there's the
possibility you know to add links and so on. So it has a lot of advantages here. Uh just important always have this
document. All right. So let's summarize a little bit what we have learned so far. So we use topic search to create an
outline for the review with broad concept no details most importantly no papers just to really understand what is
important what is not what is the main things that I have to answer the main questions and we have kind of combined
these topics into clusters and these clusters later become basically
paragraphs in our literature review. Then we use deep search or standard search or or high quality search to find
papers and to find propositions that uh supported or um detailed some of these
um parts. Yeah. some of these little bullet points that we have created the topics and then you know these expanded
it into a bunch of um sentences that we can then you know use to write our
paragraph and then we saved recent high impact papers into a folder for bulk
analysis later you know to find this needle in the haststack if we're looking for it or to build a research oracle
which is just a chat with all the papers at once allowing us to ask very specific questions very niche questions on that
already very niche topic. And that is of course not like a one, two, three step. That's something that you run through
multiple times. You just go in in circles and loops around it. But it's always the same. You go from broad
generic to to searching to actually having the papers there for you. And uh
yeah, once you have combined all that together, you have a solid literature review process that leaves you ideally
with uh you know like 30 40 or or so of these little sentences. And each
sentence is tied to a link. Yeah. And that together is what creates a
paragraph. So I can show you basically how that looks for me. So that is this
paragraph that you see here. the paragraph has has looked before I
From Notes to Literature Review Paragraphs
started writing it looked like that. So it's just basically bullet points and each of those bullet points has a
citation that added to it and then you know over time using some AI and also
some of my own um mind I created that paragraph that becomes the first
paragraph of my introduction which is essentially a literature review. So that makes it very easy and you're also kind
of never staring at this blank page that can be very scary because you end up with a bunch of these sentences that you
know if you're really lazy just copy and paste everything and say write me a nice paragraph using all these citations and they will do like a decent first job for
you that will at least you know take this paralysis out of you and and make it very easy to to move
forward. Uh all right. So a very very brief outline into the ethical
considerations. So whenever you do this, don't upload any published manuscripts. You know, Scypace might not be the the
right tool to upload manuscripts because it's it's more you know like published stuff. But that
would be a breach of con confidentiality. So don't upload anything that doesn't belong to you and that is not um completely you know under
your control. uh you have to always declare what you used in the acknowledgements. So more and more
publishers would tell you how they want it done and do not like this is from the wy um guidelines do not use AI for
basically reasoning producing scientific pedagogical or medical insights. So don't use it for reason you know use it
for collecting these uh this this bits of insight that are more or less uncontroversial but use them yourself to
reason right that is what um what sets you apart as human is that creativity and that reasoning ability so that human
supervision is required but that being said AI actually is very good at also reasoning to a certain degree so you can
 Ethical Use of AI + Final Tips & Offers
use it and you can get inspired but just be mindful that you shouldn't just copy and paste what AI tells you it can be
very wrong Um do not use AI written text as is especially for niches because AI
might just you know take something and learn somewhere and copy and paste to you verbatim and you end up um with
plagiarism accusations because you didn't copy and paste you copy and paste it from AI but AI copy and pasted it
from somebody else right so you don't want that and then remember AI makes mistakes so develop an intuition from
what what it may get wrong so that often is misinterpretation or overemphasis
because you know AI wants to please you in a way. It wants to to tell you like uh I want to get it. I want to really
answer your question. It will tell you something that's not necessarily true. So, and last thing acknowledging
the use of AI. So, in preparing of the manuscript, the author used following tools in order to following reasons.
This specific content generated by these AI technologies is clearly marked and described the dedicated appendings to be
used for editorial and review purposes. Prior to submission, the authors reviewed the content generated and takes
full responsibility for the content of the submitted manuscript. So that's how WY suggests to do it. Like if you're
publishing in some other um publishing house, you know, just look, they will probably have some sort of acknowledgement statement that they
want. So just copy and paste that tail, you know, size for analysis and you're good. Um Cypace offers discount codes.
So if you like that tool, this kind of end to end thing, then um there are a bunch of uh codes that you can use for
India Ilia 25 otherwise Ilia S 20 or 45 for monthly or yearly discounts. They
are valid until June 7th. So just about another week u because yeah, I think
that's pretty good discount. Uh yeah, so the advanced tier is what you would need
for Dreview. Uh and everything else is what you would need for high quality. So
there's like, you know, the standard quality that's also limited. And then pretty much everything that I've been showing you was using the high quality
models. And I showed you specifically the deep preview model and how that looks. And if you're interested to learn
more about my lit review processes, I have, you know, like a bunch of other processes. So size as one tool here, but
there's also, you know, like Obsidian for notetaking that I often use. I use uh draw io, which is like a free
diagramming tool. like obviously like a bunch of plugins into words. So there's the AI literature review. There's note
takingaking. How do you take notes? So I have about a half a million of words and notes and it it's incredibly useful for
me to generate new ideas. And uh one is on writing with AI. So how do we get you
know all these loose bullet points into really nice writing? Scisspace 25 is your 25% discount code. You'll find
everything on effortlessacademic.com. And with that, I thank you for your attention and I hope that um yeah, you
enjoyed it and you get something out of it. And I would open the floor to uh questions.
