From Physical Libraries to Digital Databases
I hope some of us understand or uh know what what is shown in the image. This is
a library catalog. This is the analog version of Google. Back in the day,
researchers would go to libraries, university libraries, and they would go through these library cataloges. And in
these cataloges, you will have drawers, and in every drawer, you will have index cards. And you'll go through those index
cards to find out any relevant materials for your research purposes or your
research topic. And then you would physically go to a shelf in the library and then you would take out that
journal, a copy of a journal or a book and then you would go to your office or home or wherever and then you would read
that. You can see that it involves this process involves a lot of time and
labor. What has happened over the last 20 to 20 20 to 25 years especially
is that we no longer do this. We no longer there's a there are I think there are at least two generations of
undergraduates or PhD students who do not even know how to use this and it's
not their fault at all. You know it's not it's it's a very specialized skill. But back in the day at least 30 years
ago people were trained how to use library cataloges. These days we are much more likely to do
something like this. We will not go and we will we'll we'll probably do
something like this. We'll go to Google Scholar or we'll go to say PubMed and
we'll look up relevant materials here. Yeah, we'll look up something like how
to how does social media affect mental health. We are going to uh Okay, there
is a popup here. Okay. Sorry, there's something wrong. Okay,
so we are going to uh so what we'll do is we'll go to Google Scholar or we'll
go to PubMed and look up results there instead of going to going to a physical
library like this. We'll not do that. So the point that I'm trying to make here
is that over time what has happened is that we've learned or we've built tools to outsource our labor to these online
tools or digital tools while keeping the thinking to ourselves. So for example,
we don't do this. Sorry. We don't do this. We don't go to Google Scholar. Say here
we don't go to Google Scholar and we don't ask Google Scholar what should I
research. We don't do that. You know that's not a very productive
use of Google Scholar. What we want to do is we want to come up with an idea ourselves and then we want to look up
literature using Google Scholar or PubMed or our university's online library. Yeah. So the thing that we need
to keep in mind is that it has not happened in a year or two or in a day or two. It has taken us two decades to
develop these you know uh what I would call intuitions. Now it seems very intuitive to go to Google Scholar and
not to this you know library catalog. So using Google Scholar or using PubMed or
using your university's online library or any digital tool has become sort of intuitive. It was no long it was not
intuitive 30 years ago. If we understand this part of this um this distinction
between our academic work between labor academic labor and thinking then we can
use this distinction and extrapolate it to AI. we can use this exact distinction
and take it to AI and see how we can outsource our labor to AI while keep
keeping the thinking to ourselves. So this is the first and the most important thing that we need to do is we need to
 What to Outsource to AI
outsource. We need to learn how to outsource only our labor to AI but not
thinking. We don't want AI to think for us. AI cannot think. AI can help us
think but it cannot think on its own. Similarly uh it's just like Google
Scholar cannot do research on itself uh by itself but Google Scholar can help us
conduct research. I hope that makes sense. So this is the most important thing that
we are going to u we're going to learn or we are going to have to wrap our heads around. The second important thing
 Use AI for Structure, Not Content
or the second point that I usually share with colleagues is that we need to learn
to use AI for structure and not content. We don't want to generate content with
AI. And the problem with AI content is that AI models, generative AI models
have been trained on human generated text and they are predictive in nature. So AI model, an AI app like chat, GPT
will always produce predictable text and we don't want predictable text because predictable text will have no new
insights, no new knowledge. And what we want to do is we want to have new
knowledge. We want to create new knowledge. we want to produce um and offer new insights. We want to make some
kind of original contribution to uh to our field of research. Yeah.
So AI but on the other hand let's say if I have to submit a paper to Nature or
Lancet or any other journal for that matter if I write that journal's editor
and I say hey I'm going to write this uh paper and I this time I'm trying to be really creative and I would like to
write this paper in the form of I don't know my Shakespeareian sonnet or um a rap song or I don't know Hans Christian
Anderson's fairy tale my paper would not get accepted because the editor would tell me that we have a very specific
that they have a very specific method or you know structure of a research paper
in which every research paper has to be published because that's the way they can disseminate and communicate science.
So if we use AI for structuring our papers or or our thoughts or formatting
that's fine as long as we're not creating content because if you're creating content then we are going to
end up u on a sticky wicket because that's going to cause us a bunch of uh
problems. The chief chief problem among them is the hallucinations because if you're
generating content with AI uh people who generate content with AI more often than
not do not even read the content that has been generated and if there are any hallucinations then it's your
responsibility. You will not be able to say that uh it's uh it's it's a mistake
that Chad GPT made. No, it's a mistake that you made. The third point is we
 Practical Ways to Use AI in Research
need to learn AI to use as a research. We need to treat AI as a research assistant and not a research supervisor.
And in the latter half of this presentation, what we'll do is we'll learn how to use sciace and science
agent as our research assistant. How sciencepace agent and sci-pace in general can help us outsource a lot of
academic labor. Yeah, that what that's what we are going to do. Now the uh I I
have created for myself a mental model to to interact with AI apps. What I
usually do is I treat every AI app as a smart willing eager to learn
undergraduate student. Now this student has a lot of potential has can I can
outsource a lot of work to that to this student but this student cannot think on on on themsel for themselves. Yeah. this
student still needs my my my guidance. Yeah, it's it's not an actual
undergraduate student, but it's just that I have created this persona of an undergraduate student that helps me have
a productive relationship with that AI app. So if a student if your re student
researcher or your research assistant gives you something um completes a task for you let's say you give them um five
papers and you ask them to uh hey go and read these five papers and give me their summaries and if your research assistant
gives you those summaries you will not just simply copy and paste them and uh put them in the research paper that
you're manuscript that you're writing. You will never do that because at the end of the day it's your name that's
going to be on the paper and you want to be 100% sure about everything that goes into it. Yeah.
So we are going to treat scienceace and every other AI app as our research assistants.
 Avoid Over-Reliance: Apply Common Sense
The fourth point and this is probably the most important point. Please don't
over rely on AI. there is a very very very uh it's a very slippery slope
because people would try to overrely on AI and then they would forget to use their common sense and please for the
love of God or for the love of if you don't believe in God that's fine if for
the love of any deity that you believe in or for the love of anything good that you believe in please do not forget to
use your common sense yeah that is very very important please do not forget to
use your common sense Uh I wish I could make people print this out and you know paste it on their
computers or on their um printers somewhere so that they it's right in
front of them. It's very very important not to forget to use our common sense because I tell you what people have
forgotten to use their common sense and that has resulted in huge huge disasters and embarrassment. So here is an example
 When Common Sense Is Missing
of people forgetting to use their common sense. This gentleman's name is Steven Schwarz
and he last year uh in 2023 not last year in 2023 when Chad GPD was fairly
new he used Chad GPD to uh look up citations to is for a case that he was
defending um he was working I think he was working on some case and he asked Chad GPT for some citations and Chad GPD
cooked up fake citations but they were so good for his you know argument that
he got so excited and he asked at GPD for fulllength reports to those citations and once again Chad GPD
complied. It gave fake it generated fake reports to those fake citations and
Steven Schwarz was so thrilled that he printed out that bundle of fake and submitted that in in a court of law
and the judge was let's just say that the judge was not very happy. He uh Steen Schwarz ended up getting
sanctioned and fined $5,000. Now
if you go on Google, if you just go on Google and run this goo uh chat GPT
lawyer, if you just run this search, this gentleman's face would pop up. Now I don't know about you, but I don't want
to be associated with something like this. Yeah. The second example of people
forgetting to use their common sense is this uh this is much closer to our profession of teaching and learning.
Professor Jared Mum of Texas&M again this was in 2023 he suspected that his
students were cheating with the help of Chad GPD and then he failed his whole class and at the time many of his
students Chad GPT was fairly new and many of his students didn't even know about Chat GPT's existence so when he
suspected he sent them this email he said that in grading your last three
assignments I have opened my account for chat GTP he's not even sure about the name of the app yet. I copy and paste
your responses in this account and chat GPT chat GTP will tell me if the program
generated the content. I put everyone's last three assignments through two separate times. Now the problem is that
this gentleman, this professor with a PhD is has no idea what CH GPT is. He
thinks or he wrongly assumes that CH GPT is a plagiarism checker which it is not.
Chart GPT is just a generative AI. It's it's an app that generates predictable
text. That's about it. It cannot do anything more than that. Fundamentally,
it's not a plagiarism checker. So this gentleman uh professor Jared, he
ran everybody's assignments through Chad Gad GPT and then failed the whole class.
Now this would have this would have been not that big of a deal had the students not already graduated. Now all of his
students had already graduated and they could not get their diplomas just because professor Jared mom had decided
to be cute. So this is something uh I see that from the poll we can see that uh around 50%
of us attending this webinar today uh are academics and faculty. So please
don't do this. Please don't run your students assignment through an AI app to see if it's AI generated. There is no
there is no AI detector that can with 100% certainty tell you that this is AI
generated text. Yeah. So this would be a this would this would do a lot of disservice to your students.
The third and the final example of academics forgetting to use their common sense is this example of
three scientists who published a paper in this journal called Frontiers in Cell
Biology uh frontiers in cell and developmental
biology. And they published this paper la uh last year in February. And they
used this image this AI image of a rat with a huge penis and testicles and this
was this became a huge scandal and every major academic publication and popular
publication you know wrote about it so much so that it ended up on Steven
Colbar's uh late night show. So if you spend any amount of time on
 AI Tools in Research: Current Scope & Future
social media, especially on Twitter or X these days or LinkedIn, you will come
across two types of two extreme views about AI. On the one hand, there are
proponents of AI who think that AI is going to solve all our problems. It's going to cure all the diseases. Um we
we're going to have a button that we're just going to press and it will just AI will give us a totally original research
paper. We'll submit it to nature. They will publish it. We'll get tenure and then we'll go to the beach and chillax.
That's not going to happen. That is just a fantasy. Yeah, that's not going to happen. We still have to research. We
still have to work. On the other end of the spectrum are people who think that
in a year or two or by the end of this year, we'll be ruled by AI overlords and robots will be, you know, taking over uh
the world. And this is the problem. Both of these extreme views are totally
completely and utterly useless for our purposes as academics. We don't want to
entertain these views. What we want to do is we want to learn how to use these
tools and we want to understand what these tools are. These tools are tools.
So, excuse me. My favorite example in this regard is that of a hammer. A hammer is
a simple tool. It has it's a manual tool. it. There's no AI. If I know how to use the tool, I will be able to build
furniture, do house tours around my apartment, and so on and so forth. But if I don't know how to use if I don't
know to use um a simple tool as as a tool as simple as hammer, I won't be
able to do anything. I may end up hurting my own fingers. And that has happened in the past. So we don't want
to do we don't want to misuse the tools and we don't want to forget our common
sense while we use AI. Yeah. I hope this makes sense to colleagues uh listening
and watching. Okay. So with that said now we'll jump
 SciSpace AI for Research
into how to use sciace to outsource our labor. Now the most important thing that
generative AI has enabled us to do is what I call semantic search. So let me
give you an example. Let me give you this example here.
So let's say
 Semantic Search: Google Scholar vs. SciSpace
let's say we go to Google Scholar and we run a search. If I run this search, how does social media affect mental health?
The limitation of Google Scholar is that it will it it doesn't understand the
meaning of my question. Yeah, it can take the words in my question or query
and then it can take these individual words and match these words against the words in its database. So you can see
this social media, social med media is highlighted, mental illness is highlighted because it's related to
mental health. So this is a bit of you know semantic adjacency uh a bit of semantic search we can you
know uh we can understand because mental health and mental illness are not exact same words but they are quite close. So
it can understand this much related words but not more than this. It
doesn't understand the meaning of our question and that's the limitation. Similarly similar is the case with uh
with a database like PubMed. Now with generative AI and of course we can go to
you know we can run a search download these papers and read through these papers and synthesize all this available
information for ourselves you know we've been doing this this is the way we were taught and we've been doing this you
know for the last I don't know um several decades
what generative AI has enabled us to do is to conduct or run semantic searches
so generative AI apps like sci-pace especially sci-pace what it has done is
think of sci-pace as a generative AI app think of chat GPD and then think of
academic databases so you have chat GPD and you have an academic database like Google scholar and you marry the two
together and then you uh then then the resulting product is what sci-pace is so
if I run a search let's run a simple search here if I run this search that
I have run in Google Scholar. If I run here, you will see that sci-pace can
understand the meaning of my question. And not just that. So I'm I've run this
question and this search in Scispace agent and you will see how sci-pace agent starts acting as my research
assistant. So it's it has initialized a comprehensive re um search plan for for
my question and now what it is doing is this it will show me whatever it's doing
it has started looking up through relevant papers
and you can see you can follow the uh this the process you know it's thought process sorry to to anthropom
anthropomorphize it but you can see the kind of you know the breakdown of the
process that it's uh following. So it has run it has looked up 100 results in
science own database then Google scholar pubad then archive then it's merging and
ranking search results and you can see all the papers that it's using 120
papers and then it is extracting insights. So
what is it is doing is it is it understands the meaning of my question
then goes to databases and looks up relevant papers there finds those
relevant papers then reads their abstracts then and in some cases I'm not
sure if it reads full text but it reads this I'm sure that it reads their abstracts and then based on those
abstracts it compiles a result that is in narrative pros. You can see here
this is the question uh sorry this is the answer. So here here it is. How does social
media uh affect mental health? Social media has both benefits and harms
uh with effects shared by how when and why people use platforms main effects on mental health so on and so forth. Now
unlike chat GPT what science base agent does is that it not only gives you an
answer in narrative pros but it also cites you know it it gives you an answer
with reference to actually published papers which you can see here and in here. So all these footnotes if
you hover your cursor here you will see that this is a paper that
is an actual actually published paper. This is not a fake u hallucinated
reference. Yeah. So in here science case agent will show you the
paper then it's short summary summary of the abstract tlddr and then of course
the total abstract. Let me do this the complete abstract of the paper and then
you can also ask ch um sciencepace agent. You can also ask it to explain
the paper uh explain the abstract of the paper. So you see how it is acting as your research assistant. It is not doing
the work for you but it is helping how you can interact with published
literature. And this is one of the biggest I think achievements of generative AI that it has enabled us to
run these complex semantic searches and there's a huge amount of academic data
or research papers or literature that we need to go through and science space helps us do that. So let's do this. I'll
show you not maybe AI agent for this paper but if I click click on explain abstract of this paper science base
 Go Deeper with Chat with PDF
agent will start scanning the literature and then it will explain the abstract of this paper for me and then what I can do
is I can read this and then I can ask the questions here also. So I can say uh
does this paper mention Twitter?
Something like this. Instead of downloading the paper and then doing a control F search, I can
simply type in a question here and it says no, the provided text of the paper does not mention Twitter. Yeah, very
very easy, very easy search. Then this is very convenient. If you are working
on something related to Twitter and you come across this paper, you can simply ask hey does this paper mentioned
Twitter? No, you can forget about it and you know move on to the next one. And then the other thing which is which I
found quite helpful is you can use any um you can translate this to any of
these languages. This is like I think 70 plus languages. So you can ask questions
in your language. If you're not a native speaker of English, just like me, if you're not an native speaker of English,
you can ask the questions in your language and it will reply in your language in the selected language.
That's a huge huge plus for for a lot of people whose uh first language is not
English. But let's say uh what you want to do is you have you have run this search and
 Easy Access to PDFs via SciSpace
maybe you found this paper to be very relevant and you want to read the whole paper. Now instead of doing this you can
of course do this and copy the title and then go here and then run this search.
You can do this and then look this up and do a few more clicks and you know so
on and so forth. But what this and this is a very uh very recent feature. Deepak
just told me uh I think yesterday what folks at Science have done and this is
such a such a neat you know feature. I'm really impressed with this. If you click here on PDF it will go to my
university's library and then it will give me that paper automatically. You
can see how it's doing. See I have the paper in two clicks.
So how this works is what I've done here is
what I've done is I have installed this Chrome extension. So there is this Chrome extension scpace. I have
installed this in my Chrome browser and then I have signed into my university's
library. So I've signed into my University of Southern Denmark's library and now that is integrated with lib key
and I can do this very easily from here. it it just takes one click instead of
typing this here, copying and pasting and then looking up uh on the internet and then downloading that PDF and then
realizing oh I need to go to my university's library and then download from there takes uh it's like 3 to four
five minutes of work that you can easily outsource here just by clicking on PDF
if you if that is not available I think uh it will also let you let me run
another search it also gives you it's checking availability get PDF download
from library. So in this case this particular PDF is not available from any of uh my institutions libraries so I
don't I won't be able to get it from here but I can request PDF from authors in that case. So I hope you see the
point that I'm trying to make. This is one thing that it lets us
conduct semantic searches and then it answers uh our questions with reference
to published papers. Now how do I how do we understand this this text that it has
 How to Read AI Synthesized Content
created or generated for us? What I usually do when I run these searches, I
read through this text as if I'm reading a Wikipedia article on um on a given
topic. Now Wikipedia articles are not original research but they are very well
synthesized you know pieces of writing. So this is a very well synthesized piece of writing. It's not original research.
It's there is no argument here. Yeah it's not taking any position. It cannot
take any position because it cannot construct an argument but it can synthesize a lot of information in a
very short amount of time for us. Yeah. So that's a huge plus and that's a
totally different way of interacting with published literature. Now what I don't want to do is I can read through
 Dos and Don’ts for AI-Assisted Lit Reviews
this and get the lay of the land and you know get to know what the uh what the uh
what the effects of um effects of social media on mental health are generally
I don't what I don't want to do is I don't want to copy this
and copy this open a word document
and then I don't want to do this paste it here
and then go all the way up mental effects uh main effects of on mental health by mush I don't want to do this
because that would be cheating I have not written this literature review or this overview yeah I generated generated
it with the help of an AI app I cannot pass it on as my own that would be
cheating and this is something that a lot of colleagues or students especially
think that you know this is a this is a good use case for using AI that's a very
very bad use case you should not do this you should spend your time to learn the skill of writing
 Literature Review with SciSpace Agent (Part 1)
okay let's go back to science
what sci-pace one more feature that science offers us and this is a little um this takes a
little bit of time so we are going to run this and then move on to other things. This is called deep search. Uh yeah,
deep search. If we enable deep search and if we run this question, how does
social media impact
mental health? If we run this question and if we ask sciencepace to do a deep
search, what sci-pace will do is it will take this question and then it will ask
us clarifying questions. Here you go. So it has asked us a bunch
of four clarifying questions. So starting deep review uh research on
social media's impact on mental health. Since you've requested a deep review, I'll ask some clarifying questions. So,
which demographic focus interests you most? Teenagers, young adults, working
professionals? What type of mental health outcomes are you most concerned with? Depression, anxiety, self-esteem,
so on so forth. Are you looking for specific types of social media platforms? Very good question. What's
your primary goal with this research? Yeah, academic literature review, policy recommendations. So it it it will ask
you clarifying questions so that it can give you a very tailored and specific answer to your question. So let's see if
we run this question. Um if we say that I am interested
in looking up how
social media platforms like
Twitter Twitter impact mental health
of academics who use it regularly. Yeah.
So my goal is to prepare a proposal, a grant proposal.
So I've answered almost all the questions and then if I click here,
what it will do is it will take my input and then start looking up literature
relevant to this question. Yeah, I'll conduct a comprehensive deep review focusing specifically on Twitter
and social uh similar social media platforms so on and so forth. Now this step or this deep search will take uh
can take anywhere between 5 to 10 minutes. So what we'll do is we'll leave it running here
and then we'll come back to it. It has already found 90 relevant papers and it is enhancing the search results and so
on. it'll do multi-step processes um on its own totally on its own. We don't
have to, you know, do anything here. So, we'll come back to this. Let me close
some tabs that we don't need. Okay.
So, let's go to scace here. So sciencepace is u so deep search we've
 SciSpace vs. PubMed: Literature Review
run this deep search and now another to another feature that I would like to
share with you is this literature review if we look up literature review again it
will give you standard high quality and deep review deep review will again it will take a bit of time so let's run a
high quality review let's run this high oh wow high quality review Um, how do
older people self-manage
lower back pain? If I run this,
try searching for it is going to suggest a few questions that are a little refined versions of my question. So, how
uh what role does health literacy play in the self-management of lower back pain among older adults and how can it
be improved? This is a great question. How does the presence of co-orbid morbidities influence self-management
practices and so on and so forth? So, how about we run this question
a literature review on this question. So it is going to look up available literature in several
in several you can see several databases Google Scholar, PubMed, um preprints on
archive and then it what it will do is it will give us a consolidated answer
which will be a summary or um synthesis of top 10 papers top 10 relevant papers.
Here you can see this if I go read more.
So you can see here that it's a very detailed question uh detailed answer to
my question and plus what it has done is it has given me this table of relevant
papers. Now this is a very very different kind of interaction so
compared to something like say if I run this question in PubMed. If I run this
question in PubMed, what will happen is
let's run this question. Let's load pack A in
PMED will only give me this list of results and that's about it. But what
sci-pace does is it com it it compiles or it synthesizes top relevant um it
synthesizes available information from top 10 relevant papers and then it gives me a list of these papers as well. So
this is a list of the papers that are relevant and cited.
So along with this list this list is in the form of a table and in the table in
the next column of the table you see insights. So these are short little summaries of the paper. Uh mostly the
paper paper's abstract. So this is very useful. But what I what I can also do is
I can in here there are a bunch of options to add columns to this table. So
there are suggested columns. TLDDR conclusion we already have inside. So maybe we don't need TLDDR. Summarize
abstract we don't need. But maybe we want to learn about or we want to see what kind of methods have been used. So
all we need to do is click here methods used. And what it will do is scace will
create a new column and it will tell you the methods used in every in in every
paper that it is showing you. Yeah, this feature alone will save you so much time
while looking up relevant literature. Then you can also add a bunch of other
columns. Objectives, practical implications, limitations. Here you go. So limitations column would be added in
in a matter of like 30 seconds. Then you can also say that Mustach there are
these columns are already made. These are readymade columns or pre-made
columns. I want to have a column of column of my own. So what I can do is create new column and then I can write
here um something like say
older women. I want to see it which paper discusses older women. If I create
this column it will generate
relevant information relevant to older women in every column uh in every paper.
This feature alone saves you a lot of time will can save you a lot of time if you use it smartly.
Yeah. So this table I think this is a really great tool or a really great way
of interacting with already published literature. So let's say you're conducting your literature review and you have looked up
 Word vs. SciSpace: Save to Notebook & AI Writer
a few uh useful papers and you find some things that are interesting. So what you
can do is now you want to take notes. Yeah, you can of course open up a word document
and start taking you know start copying and pasting here. You can copy this and
paste it in your word document. That's totally fine. But you can make make this process even more efficient. If you
click on this save to notebook science has this AI assistant as a
writer. So there is this notebook. I'll title this notebook
lower back pane project. And now I have this. This was copied and pasted in
here. Okay. So let me let me do this. Save to
notebook. Here you go. Yeah. Okay. So now I have
this information easily available and you know noted down here. And similarly I can do this with multiple you know
multiple tabs or multiple chunks. So whatever I find useful I can
simply take notes in my AI writer to my left. Very helpful very useful saves you
a lot of time and keeps everything very organized. And um since it is
cloud-based, you won't have to save it and there is no danger of losing your work in case your computer crashes. You
can always get a new computer, sign sign into your science account and all of
your work would be saved there available. Yeah. Then we you can also I think there is
 Chat with a Research Paper
this also this option of chatting with PDFs. So if you click on chat with PDF,
you can upload a PDF and then you can have a chat with it. Let me see if I can look up sorry any PDFs that are easily
available readily. There should be some available. Yeah, here you go. So I have uploaded
this PDF here and now it's asking me uh select a collection. So what I'm going
to do is I'm going to select or maybe I'm going to create a new folder. New
folder new folders name uh genre communities
and I'm create this folder here and upload. So now my paper would be
uploaded in this folder and now I can ask this ask questions about this paper
or I can you know I can do this also I can select this and ask it to explain.
Select this explain text simply and it will explain the text to me. I think
this is one of the oldest features in SciPace that at least I have been using since
December of 2022 or maybe January of 2023. This is one of the oldest features
that and I think they've really polished it deep. You guys have really polished it up. Very nice. And then you can also
ask questions or you can you know you this paper doesn't have any uh tables or
math. You can click here explain math and table. Select the table and it will explain
that. It won't explain this because this is a text. Maybe we can do this if you have time.
And then you can also ask questions here. Okay. What is the idea of
sorry I'm clicking many things idea of genre communities
I can simply ask a simple question and you can have a chat or you can have an interaction with
published literature uh in a very organized manner. It also has this function of creating a podcast
just like u notebook lm. So click here and then it will generate this podcast
for you. I find this feature uh quite helpful of generating podcast because if
I'm commuting, if I'm on the tram or if I'm on the bus, I can generate a podcast
of a paper and I can listen to it on the go. Um I don't I can't concentrate. I I
don't I'm unable to uh have my 100% concentration um to read a paper while
I'm commuting, but at least I can I can listen to it. So that's a very useful
way of interacting with published literature. So let's get back to our
 Literature Review with SciSpace Agent (Part 2)
search. The deep search that we had done. So the deep search is done.
You can see here the deep search is now done. So it conducted it. It undertook several
steps. You can see here uh it looked up deep uh deep search completed. It looked
up this search. It ran this search. Then multiple searches, looked up relevant
papers and then gave us this write up key findings for academics. You can see
here it has cited this this study and then here it is in Ugandan universities
large scale sentiment patterns very useful mechanisms and pathways
so on and so forth. This is you can see this is a little more detailed than a
usual standard or high quality um search and then at the end of it you have a
list of references so that you can see for yourself if these papers are real or not. Yeah, it's not giving you it's not
doing the work for you but it will help you do the work in a much more efficient manner. Okay. So the the um the the
 What’s Possible with SciSpace Agent
agent if you run here one thing that you may want to um I you know I should
mention here you can scroll down and you can see that these are the tasks or
these are the ideas that you can um or these are the things that you can do. So you can ask
sciencepace agent to look through grants.gov. So this is the US government's website and you can ask
look up uh look up this website and tell me if my project which uh which grant
should I apply for for my next project on self-management of lower back pain in
older people or you know so on so forth. So you can do that. Then you have clinical trials.gov. You can look up
clinical trials. You don't have to go to clinical trials.gov to run a search there. You can do it here. And then you
can click on show more, show more here and show more. So there are a lot of
options that you can uh that you can use. You can also run something like
 Finding Papers
look up papers on Hans Christian Anderson. This is my own
area so I'm very confident about it. Hans Christian Anderson. Um,
fairy tales in colonial tales
in colonial India only look up in the journal of
world literature. So you can specify if you want to uh you can tell it to look
through a specific journal and filter out your results. Let's see if it
follows my instruction or not. Okay, wonderful. So you can see here
I've asked this question to look uh look up these papers in the journal of world literature and the first paper is my own
paper which is in the journal of world literature. So very nice. I don't know about this, but let's see if this is a
journal of world literature paper. Let's see.
Let's see. I don't think this is a journal of world literature's paper. But anyways,
but it is no it is not a not from the journal of world literature, but it's from the same publisher.
Yeah, it's not it's looking uh it's looking up uh all the relevant papers which is not a bad thing but I think the
filter may not be working the way we would we would want it to.
Anyways, so this is something that we can do with
 Recap
let me go back to scienceace. So just to recap what we can do is we can run
semantic searches. We can interact with published literature in the form of a table and it can extract relevant data
based on our options. And there are also you can also create columns uh using the
options that are already available. You can run deep searches. Deep searches are more detailed, a little more detailed
than ordinary searches. And it will always give you uh a narrative uh an
answer in narrative pros with with references to published research and you can uh you can look up those papers that
it cites. You can simply click on it and it will give you that the the title of the paper and the abstract of the paper
and the lip key uh integration that they recently launched. Sci-pace folks
recently launched that will integrate with your university's library and will
give you the PDFs of payw world articles which is very cool and then you can take
notes and with the help of AI writer copy and paste them you with a single click you don't have to do you know
manual copy and pasting you can simply click on that save to notebook and it will do the needful and I think we are
approaching the end of the session so Here are the discount codes. Okay. So,
if you're interested in purchasing um subscription for SciPace, you will be
able to get this is a lot of discount. Oh my goodness. This is a huge discount
actually. So, you can use these two codes. If you are in India, you will be
